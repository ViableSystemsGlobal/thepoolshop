# üéØ Commission System - User Guide

## Overview

The automatic commission system creates, tracks, and manages sales commissions for agents based on paid invoices. It intelligently handles both single-agent and team deals with flexible commission rates and approval workflows.

---

## üìä How It Works

### Automatic Commission Creation

When an invoice is marked as **PAID**, the system automatically:

1. **Detects agents** associated with the invoice
2. **Calculates commissions** based on configuration
3. **Creates commission records** with PENDING status
4. **Logs the action** in the audit trail

### Agent Detection Logic

The system detects agents in the following order:

#### Scenario 1: Explicitly Assigned Agents (Team Deal)
- **When**: Multiple agents are assigned to an invoice via `AgentInvoice` table
- **Commission**: Uses **system-wide rate** (default 10%), split equally among agents
- **Example**: 3 agents on a GH‚Çµ1,000 invoice with 10% system rate
  - Each agent gets: GH‚Çµ1,000 √ó (10% √∑ 3) = GH‚Çµ33.33

#### Scenario 2: Invoice Owner is Agent (Solo Deal)
- **When**: Invoice owner (`ownerId`) is an active agent
- **Commission**: Uses agent's **personal commission rate**
- **Example**: Agent with 15% rate on GH‚Çµ1,000 invoice
  - Agent gets: GH‚Çµ1,000 √ó 15% = GH‚Çµ150

#### Scenario 3: No Agent Found
- **When**: Invoice owner is not an agent AND no agents assigned
- **Commission**: None created (expected behavior)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### System Settings

Access these in **Settings > System Settings** (or via database):

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `commission_enabled` | `true` | Enable/disable automatic commission creation |
| `commission_system_rate` | `10` | Default commission % for team deals |
| `commission_calculation_type` | `REVENUE` | Calculate on REVENUE (total) or PROFIT (total - costs) |
| `commission_min_invoice_amount` | `0` | Minimum invoice total to qualify for commission |

### Per-Agent Settings

Each agent has a `commissionRate` field (in their agent profile):
- Used for **single-agent deals**
- Can be different for each agent (e.g., senior agents get 15%, junior get 10%)
- Set when creating/editing an agent

## üîÑ Commission Workflow

### Status Flow

```
PENDING ‚Üí APPROVED ‚Üí PAID
   ‚Üì          ‚Üì
CANCELLED  CANCELLED
```

#### 1. PENDING (Auto-created)

## üíº Usage Examples

### Example 1: Single Agent Solo Sale

**Setup:**
- Agent: John Doe (AG-0002) with 12% commission rate
- Invoice: INV-001 for GH‚Çµ5,000
- Owner: John Doe

**Process:**
1. Invoice created by John Doe
2. Customer pays GH‚Çµ5,000
3. Invoice status ‚Üí PAID
4. ‚úÖ **Commission auto-created:**
   - Agent: John Doe
   - Base: GH‚Çµ5,000
   - Rate: 12% (John's personal rate)
   - Amount: GH‚Çµ600
   - Status: PENDING

### Example 2: Team Deal (3 Agents)

**Setup:**
- Agents: Alice, Bob, Charlie
- Invoice: INV-002 for GH‚Çµ10,000
- System rate: 10%
- Assigned via AgentInvoice table

**Process:**
1. Invoice created
2. 3 agents assigned to invoice
3. Customer pays GH‚Çµ10,000
4. Invoice status ‚Üí PAID
5. ‚úÖ **3 Commissions auto-created:**
   - Alice: GH‚Çµ10,000 √ó 3.33% = GH‚Çµ333.33 (PENDING)
   - Bob: GH‚Çµ10,000 √ó 3.33% = GH‚Çµ333.33 (PENDING)
   - Charlie: GH‚Çµ10,000 √ó 3.33% = GH‚Çµ333.33 (PENDING)

### Example 3: Custom Split Percentages

**Setup:**
- Primary Agent: Sarah (60% of system rate)
- Support Agent 1: Mike (20% of system rate)
- Support Agent 2: Lisa (20% of system rate)
- Invoice: INV-003 for GH‚Çµ8,000
- System rate: 10%

**Process:**
1. Invoice created
2. Agents assigned with custom splits:
   - Sarah: 6% (60% of 10%)
   - Mike: 2% (20% of 10%)
   - Lisa: 2% (20% of 10%)
3. Customer pays GH‚Çµ8,000
4. Invoice status ‚Üí PAID
5. ‚úÖ **3 Commissions auto-created:**
   - Sarah: GH‚Çµ8,000 √ó 6% = GH‚Çµ480 (PENDING)
   - Mike: GH‚Çµ8,000 √ó 2% = GH‚Çµ160 (PENDING)
   - Lisa: GH‚Çµ8,000 √ó 2% = GH‚Çµ160 (PENDING)

## üí° Best Practices

### For Single Agents
1. ‚úÖ Set each agent's personal `commissionRate` appropriately
2. ‚úÖ Invoice owner should be the agent (automatic detection)
3. ‚úÖ No need to manually assign agents

### For Team Deals
1. ‚úÖ Create invoice as usual
2. ‚úÖ Use `AgentInvoice` to assign multiple agents
3. ‚úÖ Optionally set custom `splitPercent` for each agent
4. ‚úÖ System will split the system rate appropriately

### For Approval
1. ‚úÖ Review PENDING commissions regularly
2. ‚úÖ Verify invoice is truly paid before approving
3. ‚úÖ Add notes/reason when rejecting
4. ‚úÖ Only mark as PAID when payment is actually made to agent

---

## üîç Audit Trail

Every commission action is logged in `CommissionAudit`:
- Who performed the action
- When it was performed
- Previous and new status/amounts
- Reason provided
- Additional notes

**View Audit Trail:**
- Via database: `SELECT * FROM commission_audits WHERE commissionId = 'xxx'`
- Future: Can add to UI for transparency

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **No Duplicate Commissions**: System checks if commission already exists before creating
2. **Only on PAID**: Commissions only created when invoice is fully paid, not partially paid
3. **Agent Must Be Active**: Inactive/terminated agents don't get commissions
4. **Minimum Amount**: Invoices below `commission_min_invoice_amount` don't get commissions
5. **Can Be Disabled**: Set `commission_enabled` to `false` to stop auto-creation

---
