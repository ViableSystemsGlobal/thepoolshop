## 🛠️ Detailed Restoration Steps

```bash
git reset --hard backup-working-version
git clean -fd  # Remove untracked files
```

#### Method B: Safe Switch (Preserves Recent Changes)
```bash
git stash  # Save current changes
git checkout backup-working-version
git checkout -b new-working-branch
```

#### Method C: Cherry-pick Specific Commits
```bash
git checkout backup-working-version
git checkout -b selective-restore
# Then cherry-pick only the commits you want
```

### Step 3: Verify Restoration
```bash
# Check you're on the right commit
git log --oneline -1
# Should show: bc96abc feat: Complete Orders, Payments, and Returns management systems

# Start the development server
PORT=3002 npm run dev
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

git checkout -b backup-working-version bc96abc
```

### If You Have Uncommitted Changes:
```bash
